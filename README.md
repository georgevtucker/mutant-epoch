# The Mutant Epoch character generation script
Character generation script for the awesome [The Mutant Epoch RPG](http://www.outlandarts.com/mutantepoch.htm) by William Mcausland at Outland Arts.

### But why?
My buddy Jeff and I love this game. We've spent a few evenings just rolling up from-scratch characters -- which is fun. Cumbersome, though. Every d100 roll requires squinting at a table in the rulebook to determine the result. Character attributes get modified at multiple times throughout the process. Then, at the end of character generation, calculating attack and damage values... 

Then one day I realized: isn't this the sort of thing computers are good at?

### Status
Work in process! I'm uploading early attempts to the /drafts folder in the interest of posterity. Also, who knows, maybe there's something useful in there. 

### End goal
One day I hope to run a test that results in a Bestial Human (Cockroach) character who also has mutant powers and Caste: Kitchen Slave. 

It's the little things.
